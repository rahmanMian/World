The user is allowed to make their own "World" using Spatial Graphs. This is done by simply using Points and Segments to connect them.
Once in place, this graph utilizes user input to set the points in place. The segments connect the points to each other. These segments are
then encompasses by envelopes to give the road a more natural look. Trees and Buildings are then generated around the road to give it a more
natural feel. The 3d aspect of the trees and buildings are all given by simple math equations such as linear interpolation.

The user also has the option to add different markings in the map such as a yeild, parking, lights, crosswalk, start point, and a end point. 
The lights are the only marking with a special algorithm to change colours.

The user has an option to save the world to local storage for later. This is done by coverting the world in JSON values and locally storing them.
